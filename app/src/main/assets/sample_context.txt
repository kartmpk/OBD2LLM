*   If simple (low coolant, something stuck), you might fix it.
*   However, if it's more complex, it's a good idea to get to an expert instead.
<chunk_splitter>
Code: P1351
Symptom(s):
*   Symptoms often relate to the unstable operation of the engine.
*   Once at normal temperature, it might start behaving erratically, suddenly turning off, running unstable.
*   Sometimes refusing to start if it hasn't cooled down.
*   The check engine light will also turn on.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Many possible issues.
*   The crankshaft position sensor (CKP) or camshaft position sensor (CMP) might be damaged, sending inconsistent info to the ICM.
*   The car battery might not be charged, creating inconsistencies and abnormal voltage.
*   Issues with the wiring anywhere within the ignition sensors can also be a problem.
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   The diagnostic process for this code is often fairly difficult.
*   If it's the battery, you might fix it by charging it.
*   But if it's anything else, you'll likely need knowledge of how your vehicle works.
*   If you're not well-experienced, you should probably take the issue to your local repair shop.
<chunk_splitter>
Code: P1381
Symptom(s):
*   Typically affects the engine.
*   You may have trouble starting and experience poor idling.
*   If bad, the vehicle may stall.
*   When caused by a misfire, this code can lead to transmission problems.
*   Like most codes, P1381 will trigger the check engine light.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Two causes: over-advanced variable camshaft timing and engine misfire.
*   Over-advanced timing happens when the VVT or VCT system exceeds maximum allowed settings.
*   Engine misfire here means the PCM computer can't read road conditions, treats decreases in crankshaft speed as misfires.
*   Usually happens when the PCM loses communication with the BCM.
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   A P1381 error code is a bit too complicated without technical knowledge unless you have a scanner.
*   With a scanner, read data from PCM and ECM.
*   Experienced pros might look for other codes and reset them.
*   Do a physical inspection of the VTC solenoid, connector pins, and wiring.
<chunk_splitter>
*   If parts are good, check the engine oil; very thick oil doesn't flow well.
*   Ensure your oil has low viscosity and change it regularly.
*   If the code persists, check your vehicle's service manual.
*   You may also want to check if your PCM and ECM are working correctly.
<chunk_splitter>
Code(s): P1391, P1392, P1393, P1394
Symptom(s):
*   Symptoms can vary.
*   You might have issues starting your vehicle, including not starting when the engine is cold.
*   Idling problems, especially in the first few minutes, are common.
*   Might experience longer cranking times when starting a cold engine.
*   You'll usually see the check engine light.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   For codes related to low voltage (P1391, P1393): problem often with connectors, wiring, electrical circuits, and battery voltage.
*   Low overall battery voltage usually comes with other codes.
*   For high voltage: more likely issues with the glow plug relay or timer.
*   Engine coolant, oil temperature, or intake air temperature sensors can also be causes.
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   The diagnostic process requires many steps and hard work.
*   For many people, diagnosing these is more than a casual DIYer can handle.
*   If you are a DIYer, only attempt diagnosis/repair of glow plug codes if you have a service manual and technical information.
*   Incorrect procedures can damage your entire electrical system.
<chunk_splitter>
Code: P1399
Symptom(s):
*   The first symptom is the check engine light.
*   Physical symptoms: trouble starting on a cold start.
*   If the glow plug control module fails completely, you likely won't be able to start your engine in lower temperatures.
*   In some cases, your tailpipe might emit white smoke when the engine starts.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Exact cause varies, but short circuits are usually at the root.
*   Damaged or corroded wiring connectors are also common.
*   The glow plug control module is known to trigger this code if damaged or defective.
*   The wiring leading to this module and the PCM can also cause issues if damaged.
*   Rarely, a faulty PCM can be the cause (unlikely).
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   First step: pull and record all codes and freeze frame data.
*   Sensors in the glow plug circuit rely on oil temperature and atmospheric pressure sensors, so check if these are working and damaged.
*   A technician checks the glow plug control module and its wires/connectors.
*   Establish the module's ground and input circuits.
<chunk_splitter>
*   Inspect each glow plug individually and test how well they are working.
<chunk_splitter>

*   Symptoms can range dramatically.
*   Anything from an illuminated check engine light to very hard shifting.
*   Even your vehicle going into Limp Mode.
*   Limp Mode will cause features like AC and some lights to stop working.
*   Whether Limp Mode activates depends on the vehicle.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Causes depend on which definition your vehicle is using.
*   If TFP valve problem: most likely poor electrical connection or a short circuit to the TFP Valve Position Switch.
*   If 4WD Low system issue: a short circuit between the battery and the 4WD Low indicator.
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   Diagnosis process heavily affected by this code having two different meanings. Both can be very serious.

Code: P2463
Symptom(s):
*   Many symptoms.
*   Expect the check engine light.
*   Vehicle may experience a loss of engine power (sometimes Limp Mode).
*   See a marked increase in fuel consumption or black smoke.
*   This code will also cause the vehicle to fail an emissions test.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Many causes.
*   Most common: excessive accumulation of soot particles needs cleaning.
*   Other issues: DPF pressure sensor or its wiring/connectors.
*   Can happen because of another unaddressed code (frequently related to exhaust temperature).
*   Occasionally, the EGR valve or issues with oil level and pressure.
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   Diagnostic process/repair steps are often very difficult, especially for beginners.
*   Diesel exhaust emission control system isn't very intuitive.
*   DIYers often don't understand it and waste time/money.
*   If you don't think you have the skills, always contact a professional.

Code: P2859
Symptom(s):
*   The first symptom is likely the check engine light.
*   Fairly uncommon to see significant driving problems.
*   Code means it had some issue with smoothly disengaging.
*   If any other symptoms, they'll often be minor issues with gear shifting.
Cause(s):
*   Many possible causes.
*   This code is extremely vague.
*   Problem could be anything from engine load concerns to hydraulic pressure.
*   Not a complete list, but here are a few causes you might look for... (list not provided). (Note: [153, P3404] appears to be a source artifact here)
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   (Source does not provide Diagnosis Next Steps for P2859)
<chunk_splitter>
Code: P3404
Symptom(s):
*   Symptoms rarely extremely disabling.
*   Most commonly: the check engine light turn on (sometimes only sign).
*   System reduces engine power for fuel use, so may see decreased engine performance, increased fuel consumption, or both.
*   Engine defaults to 8 cylinders, turns off injector for faulty cylinder.
<chunk_splitter>
Cause(s):
*   Low engine oil level is a very common cause.
*   Vehicle uses oil pressure for hydraulic valve lifters that turn cylinders on/off.
*   If oil too low, not enough pressure.
*   Other possible causes: issue with cylinder displacement solenoid.
*   General wiring problems.
*   Cramped oil passages.
<chunk_splitter>
*   A bad oil pressure sensor.
*   Defective variable valve timing solenoids.
*   Open or shorted cylinder deactivation circuits.
*   A compressed exhaust system.
*   An unlocked solenoid wiring harness.
*   PCM computer issues.
*   Even mechanical problems with the engine.
<chunk_splitter>
Diagnosis Next Step(s):
*   Often depends on the underlying cause.
*   If low oil, adding oil might fix it.
*   ECM might activate other codes.
*   These are typically the only symptoms.
*   Subtle issue most won't notice until catastrophic engine failure. Staying alert is a good first step.
<chunk_splitter>
*   This code can be quite difficult for a casual DIYer.
*   Basic repair: check if your engine oil level is correct.
*   Might need to do a manual oil pressure test.
*   Take your car to a repair shop for more complicated repairs. Experts have the right scan tools. Might save your engine from total failure.
